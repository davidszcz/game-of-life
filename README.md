# Game of Life

## Description

**Conway's Game of Life web version!** 

Conway's Game of Life is a zero player game devised by John Horton Conway in 1970. 
It is turing complete (system is able to recognize ordecide other data-manipulation rules) and can simulate a universal constructor.
The rules of the game are any live cell with two or three live neighbors survive, any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell, amd all other live cells die in the next generation, and that other dead cells stay dead.
I hope this repository is a good simulation for game of life. 
This repository will demonstrate the game of life and serve as a simulation of algorithms creating turing complete models.

## Contributing

I also hope this repository is a [good starting point](https://github.com/TroyTae/game-of-life/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) for first-time contributors.
If there are any patterns you find that are not listed in the patterns folder you can add them there in either the still life or oscilator folder, depending on what the pattern style is.
Most functions will be found within the src directory.

## Run and Use Project

Install and Run the dev server with npm install, npm run start, and then open localhost::1234 within browser.
The project should begin to run once these steps are completed.

## Testing

Run npm run test to validate code and tests you have implemented.

## Demo
